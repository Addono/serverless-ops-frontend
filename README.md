# Production Ready Serverless Ops Bolerplate - Frontend


This is the second part of [the boilerplate](https://github.com/azarboon/serverless-ops-boilerplate). Users need to sign in, so they can see weather report.

To handle authentication witn AWS Cognito, I have leveraged [Amazon Cognito Identity SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-cognito-identity-js), but it had a bug. So I had to fix the bug, put the fixed version inside the app and bundle it.
